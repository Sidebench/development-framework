# Wiki Template

Welcome to the project Wiki template :-)

## Getting Started

The `Getting Started` page/section should be a quick overview highlighting and linking to the project README as the best place to get started.

### Pages/Sections

Add a Wiki page/section for each relevant/related section listed below. A page for `Getting Started` should be included, but the subsections for the README only need to live in the README and are only listed below for reference.
